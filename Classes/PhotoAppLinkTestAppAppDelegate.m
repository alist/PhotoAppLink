// by other apps implementing the Photo App Link protocol.

    //       always be called rather than the applicationDidFinishLaunching: & handleOpenURL: combination.
    //       Under 2.x didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: will be ignored, so a different code path will be taken at launch.
    //       If your code does not currently implement handleOpenURL: I would recommend the scheme used in this example: 
    //          use didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: to handle URL & notification launches, forward normal launches 
    //          to applicationDidFinishLaunching: (which will also be called directly when running under 2.x)
    
    // Simply accessing the applink manager here triggers a background update of the list of supported apps
    // (if necessary). So do this first thing. 
    // If you are using applicationDidFinishLaunching: & handleOpenURL: make sure you stick this into 
    // applicationDidFinishLaunching: in order to trigger the implicit background update.
